# personal_resume
This repository is the result of Codecademy's personal portfolio assignment from the Front-End Development course.

## 1.Project Title: 
Personal resume portfolio.

## 2.Description: 
This project is a task from Codecademy’s course on Front-End Development where following goals must be reached:

- _Develop an idea of personal portfolio and plan this project._
- _Sketch or make a wireframe of the web page._
- _Create files and deploy them locally._
- _Initialize local folder with git tracking via Terminal and make commits._
- _Build a main page and contact page with the use of HTML._
- _Style the content with the use of CSS._
- _Make it responsive for Tablet and Phone._
- _Add interactivity with JS._
- _Publish the page to the GitHub Pages._

Even though the initial topic is “My personal portfolio” I had made decision to deviate a little from it and describe my life in as a short resume as portfolio like layout. 
The description is a compilation of gathered experiences, interests and my preferences that lead for me to start studying Front-End Development course. I believe that work is not only showcasing my current skills but also helps to convey they story why am I doing this and how I got here.
