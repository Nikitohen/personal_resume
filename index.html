        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
          In childhood I have developed an interest to
          <strong>fine arts</strong>, <strong>handcraft</strong> and sand
          <strong>sculpting</strong>. Spending my free time painting, sketching,
          building sand pyramids of various shapes and forms, working with clay,
          plastics and metal to repair broken toys and create new gadgets.<br />I
          also loved to teach myself how to use new home appliances and its
          functions via handbooks in English language. As a result I taught
          myself English with the use of vocabulary.

        <h2>Early 90s</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
          Since my father was radio officer on sea vessels I got my first Sega
          video game console as birthday present as it was released. This moment
          marked an incredible time diving deep in games and learning them.
          Later on I got my hands on Sony Playstation, a giant leap towards 3D
          gaming experience.<br />I remember myself observing
          <strong>graphic elements</strong>
          in games and later on repainting them on paper.

        <h2>Early 2000s</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
          In early 2000s I got my first personal computer with Windows
          Millenium. This opened my eyes to a new range of online games and
          especially, the use of <strong>internet</strong>. It was the moment
          when I started to investigate <strong>computer software</strong>,
          <strong>files</strong>, <strong>graphics</strong> and use of
          <strong>information</strong>. <br />I was reading online how to use
          computer and eventually taught how to reinstall windows, download and
          install software, burn CDs, and replace hardware parts on my own.

        <h2>Mid 2000s</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
          Graduating from high school and not seeing how my interests and skills
          can aid me choosing career I went to China to see my father. At that
          time I was engaged with <strong>digital photography</strong> and
          <strong>photo editing</strong>. <br />Eventually, I found myself
          working for food sourcing company in China for 2 years as IT Support
          Specialist and Field Service Technician. I used to draw in CAD, set-up
          satellite call stations, install and configure vessel navigation
          software and aid in office with IT questions. And again, all these
          were self-taught disciplines.

      <section class="education left">
        <h2>2008-2012</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
          I returned home and got Bachelor Degree in European Business and
          gained understanding of <strong>business fundamentals</strong>,
          <strong>communication</strong>, <strong>management</strong>,
          <strong>finance</strong>, <strong>economics</strong>, European law,
          French and a little of Spanish languages.<br />My interest in
          <strong>night photography</strong> and use of
          <strong>photo editing</strong> tools made me thinking how to make web
          page to display images online. But I got confused about complexity of
          programming, and personal biases of not knowing math kicked in.<br />As
          a result my friend stepped in and made
          <a href="www.light-fusion.com">www.light-fusion.com</a> as his pet
          project on PHP.

      <section class="finance right">
        <h2>2012-2017</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
          Throughout this period I worked in banking as
          <strong>client support</strong> and other financial firms as
          <strong>client manager</strong> sourcing clients and connecting secure
          payment infrastructure to <strong>e-commerce</strong> platforms of
          their choice.<br />It was time when I noticed how it is convenient and
          interesting to have e-commerce business online.<br />At that time, I
          also got passionate with motorcycle riding and obtained an interest
          servicing and repairing them.

        <h2>2018-2023</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
          In 2018 my life got an eventual turn and a road accident brought me to
          study welding and do repairs of my motorcycle on my own.<br />I got my
          TIG <strong>welding certification</strong> and ended up being employed
          as <strong>project manager</strong> at the place of my practice.<br />As
          a result I gained experience in
          <strong>industrial manufacturing</strong>,
          <strong>civil engineering</strong>,
          <strong>metal fabrication</strong>, and <strong>production</strong>,
          as later on I had additional position as
          <strong>manager of manufacturing</strong>. These roles were of high
          responsibility, a lot of stress, and teamwork dependent.

      <section class="current-time right">
        <h2>2023 and on</h2>
        <p class="text-block">
          As a result of COVID and further war conflict in 2022, manufacturing
          sector had seen decline and eventually in a year I could no longer
          find a position.<br />This had led me to go back in my timeline,
          review my personality, obtained skills, competencies, acquired
          knowledge, passions, engagements and involvements which I combined
          with certain expectations of my future position and decided to try and
          become Software Developer.<br />As a result I finished course on
          <strong>Manual Testing</strong> and had intensive course on
          <strong>Automation Testing</strong> as complimentary and introductory
          part to software development process. And further on I enrolled and
          currently keep learning <strong>Front-End Development</strong>
          self-taught course as it fully reflects my interests and passions.
